  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My name is Juan Moreno, and I am currently studying Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. As an artist I am really interested in video game art and fictional heroes. These have inspired me to
    become an artist and I always strive to create and design something dynamic elegant, and powerful.</p>
  <p> In my works I use video games and fictional heroes as a source of inspiration. These can easily be seen in my video projects as in one of them I treat video games as if they were something delicate and important such as art, due to the fact that I respect and appreciate the forms of art that make up a video game (writing, music, art, design, etc.) and not many do. In another of my works I show a comparison between fictional heroes and real people (heroes), in hopes to create something powerful for my audience to think about and at the same time show my interest in fictional heroes.
