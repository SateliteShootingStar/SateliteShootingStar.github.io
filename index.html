      games should be considered art.</p>

    <p>This project depicts Fictional Heroes, and Real Life Heroes through a side by side comparison in
      order to bring attention to the fact that “Heroes” are not always what we see up in the big screens and comic books.
      One must think of the real life people that dedicate their lives to help and protect others,
      raise a family as a single parent, and those who sometimes go as far as to risk their own life to protect lives.
      That is a what a Hero should be.</p>
